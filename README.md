## Inspiration

This extension has been inspired by the GitHub user RafaelKoch with his post https://github.com/Microsoft/AL/issues/1007 to implement regions into the AL language. I've been using the suggestion of anzwdev to manually add it to the al extension every month. I got tired of it so I created this extension to do it automatically.
